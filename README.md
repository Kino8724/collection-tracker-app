# Collection Tracker App

This project is a personal project I've wanted to build for a long time now. It is for the purpose of helping those who have large collections and would like the ability to keep track of all their stuff easier.
## 5 W's of this project

### Who

This is for anyone with a big collection of anything or many things!

### What

It is an application built with React Native and stores all of the information of the collection(s) locally on the phone using SQLite so no pesky cloud database costs :3

### When

This could be used for helping start a collection, or for a collection that has been going for years!

### Where

Currently only able to be ran using Expo Go App and running the server locally, however, looking to deploy to the app store in the future

### Why

I am building this for my beautiful girlfriend who has many different collections, but one in particular spans hundreds of items and noticed her struggle of keeping track of what all she has. I wanna help alleviate that issue not just for her, but anyone else who may face the same issue :)

----------

## Feature List 

- Full SQL database that tracks collections and items that are within those collections
- Full CRUD ability for collections and items in them
- All stored locally so ability to access offline
